# Project5.Membership-Database
Simple Membership Database Generator
This program is designed to allow an Employer to build a database of their employees and view the information. The information that we include are as such: First Name, Last Name, Liscense Number, Address, Birth Date, Employer, Phone Number, and Email Address.  This was specifically made for bars and pubs in North Carolina to meet basic ALE(Alcohol Law enforcement) requirements. To run the program all an individual has to do is run the executable file.
